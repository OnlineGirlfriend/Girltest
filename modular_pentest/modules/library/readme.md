## \<Library Update>

Module ID:LIBRARY

### Description:

- Replaces bible icons with /tg/ icons.
- Replaces icons for several granters, for consistent perspective.
- Adds unique books (lib_items.dm).
- Adds guestbooks (guestbook.dm).
- Adds journals (journal.dm).
- Adds new bibles, the Dating Survival Guide and the Water Bolt (modular book.dm).

Below is a description of how books and bibles are organized in Pentest as of this PR. Hopefully this will save someone time.

**Code**

- Shiptest book.dm defines bibles and the hollowed book.
- Shiptest granters.dm handles behavior for books that teach things (granters).
- Shiptest manuals.dm handles manuals.
- Shiptest spellbook.dm handles the spellbook object and behavior for wizards.
- Shiptest lib_items.dm handles bookshelves, barcode scanners, and player-written books.
- Exceptions to the above include the Book of Babel, the codespeak manual, and the dronespeak manual, which, for whatever reason, are standalone items located in their respective files. This module individually overrides icons for these in lib_items.dm.

- Pentest book.dm adds chaplain's bible icon selection and blessings. Pentest original bibles are also here.
- We currently do not have a modular granters.dm or manuals.dm but should add them to this module as needed to store new granters and manuals.
- Pentest lib_items.dm (added in this module) contains the icon override for all non-bible books. Any library-related code not in one of the above-listed files will also go here.
- Guestbook.dm and journal.dm (added in this module) handle guestbooks and journals, respectively.

**Icons**

- Shiptest storage.dmi contains Shiptest's bible icons.
- Shiptest library.dmi contains Shiptest's non-bible book icons (i.e., granters and manuals) and other library items.

- All book-related icons for Pentest are contained in this module.
- In-hand sprites for Pentest original bibles are in our books_lefthand.dmi and books_righthand.dmi. 
- Journal sprites are in journal.dmi.
- Everything else (including bibles, granters, manuels, and guestbooks) is in library.dmi. I did this to make it easier to update icons in the future.
