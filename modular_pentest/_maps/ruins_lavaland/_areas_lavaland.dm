### Purpose: For Pentest custom areas on lavaland ruins.

### This file contains a list of all the areas in any lavaland ruin. Format is as follows:

/area/CATEGORY/OR/DESCRIPTOR/NAME 	(you can make as many subdivisions as you want)
	name = "NICE NAME" 				(not required but makes things really nice)
	icon = 'ICON FILENAME' 			(defaults to 'icons/turf/areas.dmi')
	icon_state = "NAME OF ICON" 	(defaults to "unknown" (blank))
	requires_power = FALSE 				(defaults to true)
	ambientsounds = list()				(defaults to GENERIC from sound.dm. override it as "ambientsounds = list('sound/ambience/signal.ogg')" or using another define.

NOTE: Not all are required, and can pull from their parent area. Refer to other ST areas. - Ossa
