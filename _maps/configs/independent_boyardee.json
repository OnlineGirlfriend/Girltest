	"description": "Named after an ancient Terran cultural figure celebrated for revolutionizing the preparation and distribution of food, the Boyardee-class remains a beloved civilian vessel renowned for its hospitality and charm. Designed to provide a reprieve from the monotony of synthesized meals and ration packs, these ships are equipped with a fully stocked bar, advanced hydroponics systems, a spacious kitchen, and an expansive dining area, making them a favorite among weary travelers and colonists alike. Over time, various factions have modified the Boyardee-class for purposes ranging from trade hubs to morale-boosting outposts, though these variants are now rare in the Frontier.",
