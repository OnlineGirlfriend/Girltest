	"description": "While the most famous colony ships were hulking, highly-advanced affairs designed to ferry hundreds-if-not-thousands of settlers to far-off worlds and create cities in a matter of months – the Kalixcian Moonlight, the Candor, the First Train to Fort Sol – the Bubble-class is designed to cater to homesteaders aiming to establish a small ranch or village out in the great vastness of space. The Bubble-class is highly compact but complete with all the necessities for colony creation – extensive R&D equipment, robust mining gear, and a small selection of personal arms for fending off hostile fauna. While the Bubble-class has been historically utilized by the Terran Federation for colony efforts, their proprietary version has recently been phased out of operation.",
