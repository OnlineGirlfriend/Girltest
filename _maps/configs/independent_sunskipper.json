	"description": "The Sunskipper-class is a state-of-the-art culinary vessel found in the frontier. It's name is a wordplay between a Kalixcian species of butterfly and ship's unique solar-powered batteries. The Sunskipper is welcomed with open arms by weary spacers of greater paycheks, who are fatigued by the monotony of their everyday meals. The ship features a self-sustaining kitchen with hydroponics and a large, deluxe dining hall, designed to serve starved travelers. It also comes with a fully-stocked bar area that allows them to drink their troubles away, if even for a brief moment.",
