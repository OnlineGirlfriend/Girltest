changes:
  - {bugfix: Turret controls can be taken down with a crowbar and face the right
      direction when mounted on a wall.}
  - {refactor: Turret controls are now linked to individual turrets through 
      their buffer instead of the other way around (minimizes running back and 
      forth).}
delete-after: true
