  - {rscadd: 'Most if not all planets have gotten a resprite add: Some new missions.'}
  - {rscadd: 'These missions might lead you to a "new" planet... add: Overmap Mechanics
      have been overhauled'}
  - {rscadd: Interactions; you can now choose where exactly to dock and how to

  - {rscadd: Suns should be actually dangerous to go near}
  - {rscadd: Suns are actually dangerous}
  - {rscadd: "See https://github.com/shiptest-ss13/Shiptest/pull/3868 for more add:
      Radio interference based on radio's location on the overmap. For example, moving

      reduce this significantly."}
  - {rscadd: New Ore Overhaul}
  - {rscadd: 'Some temperature changes missed by the temp pr should be addressed balance:

  - {bugfix: Carbon monoxide should work better now.}
  - {code_imp: Framework for ship to ship docking}
  - {code_imp: 'Overmap code is much more modular and robust now. del: Removes cryosickness'}
  - {balance: 'Explosions, acid and electrocute acts all do alot less damage.'}
  - {code_imp: Removes redundent signal for ship moving}
  - {rscdel: 'Removed carbon steel and all Overmap 5 minerals like copper, silicon,
